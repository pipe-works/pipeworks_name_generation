# Name Class Matrix - Selection policies for different name types
#
# This file defines the feature preferences for each name class.
# It is the externalized policy configuration for the name_selector tool.
#
# Each name class defines:
#   - description: Human-readable purpose and optimization goal
#   - syllable_range: [min, max] syllables (inclusive)
#   - features: Policy for each of the 12 phonetic features
#
# Feature policy values:
#   - preferred:   +1 score, actively sought
#   - tolerated:    0 score, neutral (neither helps nor hurts)
#   - discouraged: Hard reject (hard mode) or -10 score (soft mode)
#
# The 12 features are grouped by position:
#   Onset:    starts_with_vowel, starts_with_cluster, starts_with_heavy_cluster
#   Internal: contains_plosive, contains_fricative, contains_liquid, contains_nasal
#   Nucleus:  short_vowel, long_vowel
#   Coda:     ends_with_vowel, ends_with_nasal, ends_with_stop
#
# See: build_tools/syllable_feature_annotator/feature_rules.py for detector implementations
# See: _working/sfa_name_ontology_and_selection.md for design rationale

  # First Name - Direct Social Address
  # ============================================================================
  # Primary function: Addressability
  # Optimized for: Easy to call out, pleasant mouth-feel, approachable

  # - Prefer vowel endings (open syllables, easy to extend/call)
  # - Prefer liquids (flowing, pleasant texture)
  # - Avoid heavy clusters (too harsh for casual address)
  # - Avoid stop endings (too abrupt for social warmth)
