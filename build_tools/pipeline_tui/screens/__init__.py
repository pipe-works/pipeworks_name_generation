"""
Screen modules for Pipeline TUI.

This package will contain dedicated screen classes for different
parts of the pipeline TUI interface.

**Planned Screens:**

- :class:`ConfigScreen` - Pipeline configuration interface
- :class:`MonitorScreen` - Job monitoring and log display
- :class:`HistoryScreen` - Previous run browser

Currently, these screens are implemented inline in the main app.
They will be extracted to separate modules as the implementation grows.
