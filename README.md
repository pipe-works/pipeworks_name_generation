# pipeworks_name_generation

> A lightweight, phonetic name generator that produces names which *sound right*,
> without imposing what they *mean*.

`pipeworks_name_generation` is a standalone, GPL-3 licensed name generation system based on
phonetic and syllabic recombination. It generates **pronounceable, neutral names** intended
to act purely as labels. Any narrative, cultural, or semantic meaning is deliberately left
to downstream systems.

This project is designed to stand on its own and can be used independently of Pipeworks in
games, simulations, world-building tools, or other generative systems.

## Key Features

- **Linguistically Plausible**: Generates names that sound right, not random strings.
- **Deterministic Generation**: The same seed will always produce the same name.
- **Zero Runtime Dependencies**: Lightweight, predictable, and stable for the core generator.
- **Context-Free**: Avoids direct copying of real names or source material.
- **Comprehensive Build Tools**: A full suite for corpus linguistics and data preparation.
- **Fully Documented & Tested**: High test coverage and automated documentation.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install pipeworks-name-generation
```

### Generate Your First Name

```python
from pipeworks_name_generation import NameGenerator

# Create a generator
gen = NameGenerator(pattern="simple")

# Generate a name deterministically
name = gen.generate(seed=42)
print(name)  # "Kawyn"

# Same seed = same name (always!)
assert gen.generate(seed=42) == name
```

---

## Build Tools

The project includes a comprehensive suite of build-time tools for corpus linguistics:

- **Syllable Extractor** - Dictionary-based extraction using pyphen (40+ languages).
- **NLTK Syllable Extractor** - Phonetically-guided extraction using CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (English only).
- **Syllable Normaliser** - A 3-step pipeline for canonicalization and frequency analysis.
- **Syllable Feature Annotator** - Phonetic feature detection (e.g., onsets, codas).
- **Syllable Walker** - Interactive exploration of the phonetic feature space.
- **Corpus Database** - A build provenance ledger for tracking extraction runs.
- **Analysis Tools** - Tools for feature analysis, t-SNE visualization, and random sampling.

**Quick example:**

```bash
# Option 1: Extract syllables with pyphen (typographic hyphenation, 40+ languages)
python -m build_tools.pyphen_syllable_extractor --file input.txt --auto

# Option 2: Extract syllables with NLTK (phonetic splits, English only)
python -m build_tools.nltk_syllable_extractor --file input.txt

# Normalize the extracted syllables (works with either extractor)
python -m build_tools.pyphen_syllable_normaliser --source _working/output/
```

### NLTK Extractor Setup

The NLTK syllable extractor uses the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary:

```bash
# Install build tools (includes cmudict pip package)
pip install -e ".[build-tools]"
```

No additional setup required - CMUDict data is included in the pip package!

## Design Philosophy

Names generated by this system are **structural**, not narrative.

They are designed to feel: plausible, consistent, and pronounceable.

...but not authoritative.

Meaning, history, and interpretation are applied later, elsewhere.

## Non-Goals

This project deliberately does **not**:

- Encode lore, narrative meaning, or symbolism.
- Distinguish between characters, places, or objects.
- Imply cultural, regional, or historical identity.
- Enforce genre-specific naming conventions.

All such concerns are expected to be handled by consuming applications.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aa-parky/pipeworks_name_generation.git
